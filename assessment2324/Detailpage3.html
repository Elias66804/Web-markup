      Finding a place to stay in Haarlem before you even get there is pretty
      ideal. If you managed to secure a place in advance then all that’s left
      to do is register at the city office, collect your Dutch Citizen Service
      Number (BSN), and start your journey. But don’t worry if you didn’t find
      a spot yet because there are options.

    <h1 class="para1">Booking a Hostel in Haarlem:</h1>
    <p class="para1text">
      If it doesn’t seem like a possibility for you to rent somewhere or know
      someone who will let you stay with them, booking a hostel is the perfect
      solution. There are not many hostels but one option is “Stayokay
      Hostels” which is north of the city center. The good thing about Haarlem
      is that public transportation is really efficient so getting around
      won’t be an issue. The number 2 bus conveniently picks you up right from
      the hostel and takes you downtown in just 15 minutes.
