        If you’re planning on studying or working in Haarlem, the Netherlands,
        you’ll probably need a place to live. It’s a tough task when you’re on a
        time limit, but we got you covered. Here are some resources and
        information to make your search as smooth as possible.
      </p>
      <h1 class="para1">Student Accommodations:</h1>
      <img src="img/Duwo.png" alt="img" class="Duwo" />
      <h6 class="imagetext">Duwo student Students acccomodation</h6>

      <p class="rep0">
        Students will have an easier time on room.nl. They specialize in helping
        students find rooms across the Netherlands. Here’s what you need to
        know:
      </p>
      <section class="rep01">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Waiting Lists: Almost always, you're going to be waiting for someone
            to move out. This is especially true in cities like Haarlem and
            Amsterdam. Increase your chances of getting a room by registering
            early.
          </li>
          <li>
            Response System: Just like Uber does with drivers, room.nl does with
            rooms. Whenever there’s one available, express your interest right
            away. Rooms go quick.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h1 class="para2">Popular Dutch housing websites:</h1>
      <img src="img/Derb.png" alt="img" class="Derb" />
      <p class="rep1">
        If traditional student dormitories aren’t your thing, then maybe these
        options will be. Shared apartments, studios, and houses can all be found
        on websites such as your University webpage, Housing Anywhere, and
        StudentenWoningWeb. If you’re in a rush to find a home, look no further
        than these popular Dutch housing websites:
      </p>
      <aside class="rep2">
        <ul>
          <li>Fund​a.nl comprehensive platform for rental properties.</li>
          <li>
            Pararius.nl specialises in rental properties for expats and
            students.
          </li>
          <li>Huurwoningen.nl offers a wide range of rental listings.</li>
          <li>
            Kamernet.nl ideal for finding rooms and shared accommodations.
          </li>
          <li>
            HousingAnywhere.com Connects students and young professionals with
            available housing.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
      <h1 class="para3">Social Media and Facebook Groups:</h1>
      <img src="img/Face.png" alt="img" class="face" />

      <p class="rep3">
        Another useful way is through Social media. There are Facebook groups
        dedicated to finding homes. In these groups, you’ll often find members
        who post available apartments or rooms. However, be cautious when doing
        this as there are scams everywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="rep4">
        Never send money without seeing the property or meeting the landlord
        face-to-face. Always request a formal lease agreement Research the
        person’s background offering you accommodations Stick to trusted
        platforms for transactions and communication
      </p>
      <p class="rep5">
        Finding accommodations anywhere could be challenging. Especially in
        Haarlem and the Netherlands as a whole. But with the right resources and
        a cautious approach, landlords will have trouble evicting you once your
        lease is up (kidding). Good luck!
