    <H1>About me :</H1>
    <p>Greetings! I'm Othmane Sarhane, although my friends and family affectionately call me Elias. At the youthful age of 19, I currently reside in the charming city of Haarlem, where I've embarked on a journey pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Inholland University of Applied Sciences.
        My roots trace back to Casablanca, Morocco, a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture and history. However, my adventure also took me to Norway for a year, where I delved into the intricacies of the Norwegian language. Consequently, I now proudly converse in Arabic, French, English, and, of course, Norwegian.
        Horse riding used to be a cherished hobby of mine during my days in Morocco. In my leisure hours, I find solace in the company of friends, exploring the nooks and crannies of this new city that I call home. Discovering Haarlem's hidden gems has become an exciting pastime for me.
